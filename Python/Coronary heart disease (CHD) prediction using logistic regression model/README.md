## Coronary heart disease (CHD) prediction using logistic regression model
#### The task was to: <br>
A create a logistic regression model and predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) <br>
B interpret models' coefficients and odds ratios <br>
C assess the model with performance metrics

The project was made using Jupyter Notebook and the result can be found in the file CHD_prediction_logistic_regression.ipynb.

The given dataset (file data.csv) was from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. 

#### Data attributes description:
*  Sex: male or female (Nominal)
*  Age: Age of the patient
*  Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (Nominal)
*  Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day (Continuous)
*  BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)
*  Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)
*  Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)
*  Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)
*  Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)
*  Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)
*  Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)
*  BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)
*  Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous)
*  Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)

##### Predict variable (desired target)
*  10-year risk of coronary heart disease CHD (binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”).
