## This folder contains SQL tasks made using the BigQuery environment

In these tasks, I was asked to create queries to solve specific business questions.
I had to explore 'AdventureWorks 2005' [database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms), identify the needed data and the correct way to get it/merge it together with other tables within this database.

* Task 1: An Overview of Products
* Task 2: Reporting Sales numbers
